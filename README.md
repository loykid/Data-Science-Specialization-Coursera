Programming Assignment

Completed data set is called "final_tidy.txt"
Added many comments to the code to explain what I did

Things I did:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
   average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
